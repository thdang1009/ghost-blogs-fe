# Product Requirements Document: Series Navigation Feature

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a new feature that will allow users to easily navigate between consecutive posts within a blog series. It will also describe the administrative interface needed for blog administrators to define the sequential order of posts within a series.

**2. Goals**

* Enhance user experience by providing a seamless way to read through a series of related blog posts in the intended order.
* Increase user engagement by encouraging users to explore the complete content of a series.
* Provide blog administrators with a simple and intuitive way to manage the order of posts within a series.

**3. User Stories**

* As a blog user, when I am reading a post that belongs to a series, I want to see a clear link to the previous post in the series (if one exists).
* As a blog user, when I am reading a post that belongs to a series, I want to see a clear link to the next post in the series (if one exists).
* As a blog administrator, when I am creating or editing a blog post, I want to be able to specify the previous post in the series for the current post.
* As a blog administrator, when I am creating or editing a blog post, I want to be able to specify the next post in the series for the current post.
* As a blog administrator, I want the system to automatically understand that if I set Post B as the "next" post for Post A, then Post A should be considered the "previous" post for Post B.

**4. Functional Requirements**

**4.1. Post Editing Interface Modifications:**

* **Previous Post Selector:** When creating or editing a blog post, a new section related to series navigation will be added to the editing interface. This section will include a dropdown or search field allowing the administrator to select another existing blog post within the *same* series to be designated as the "Previous Episode/Post".
* **Next Post Selector:** Similarly, another dropdown or search field will be available for the administrator to select an existing blog post within the *same* series to be designated as the "Next Episode/Post".
* **Series Association:** This feature will rely on the existing "Series" functionality. The previous and next post selection should only allow choosing posts that belong to the same series as the current post. The system should prevent linking to posts outside the current series.
* **Mutual Linking Logic:** When an administrator sets Post B as the "Next Post" for Post A, the system should automatically store Post A as the "Previous Post" for Post B in the backend. This ensures bidirectional navigation.

**4.2. Frontend Display Modifications (Single Post View):**

* **"Previous Episode" Link/Button:** On the page displaying a single blog post, if a "Previous Post" has been defined for that post, a clearly visible link or button labeled "Previous Episode" or a similar term should be displayed. This element should link to the designated previous post within the series. The placement could be above or below the main post content, or potentially in a side navigation.
* **"Next Episode" Link/Button:** Similarly, if a "Next Post" has been defined, a clearly visible link or button labeled "Next Episode" or a similar term should be displayed, linking to the designated next post in the series. The placement should be consistent with the "Previous Episode" element.
* **Conditional Display:** These "Previous" and "Next" navigation elements should only be displayed if a corresponding previous or next post has been set by the administrator. If a post is the first in a series, only the "Next Episode" might appear (if set). If it's the last, only the "Previous Episode" might appear.

**5. Technical Requirements**

* **Database Schema Update:** The blog post data model in the database needs to be updated to include two new fields: `previousPostId` and `nextPostId`. These fields will store references (likely IDs) to other blog posts.
* **Backend Logic:** Backend logic will be required to:
    * Handle the saving and retrieval of the `previousPostId` and `nextPostId` when creating and editing posts.
    * Implement the mutual linking logic (when next is set for A to B, previous is automatically set for B to A).
    * Ensure that only posts within the same series can be linked as previous or next.
* **Frontend Implementation:** Frontend code will need to:
    * Retrieve the `previousPostId` and `nextPostId` for the current post.
    * Generate the appropriate "Previous Episode" and "Next Episode" links/buttons with the correct URLs.
    * Handle cases where there is no previous or next post.

**6. UI/UX Considerations**

* The "Previous Episode" and "Next Episode" navigation elements should be clearly distinguishable and easy to locate on the page.
* The labels used for these elements should be consistent and intuitive (e.g., "Previous in Series," "Next in Series," or "Previous Episode," "Next Episode").
* The dropdown or search fields in the admin interface should be user-friendly for selecting other posts. Filtering the list of available posts to only show those within the same series is crucial.

**7. Acceptance Criteria**

* When a blog post has a designated "Previous Post" in the same series, a clearly labeled link to that post is displayed on the single post page.
* When a blog post has a designated "Next Post" in the same series, a clearly labeled link to that post is displayed on the single post page.
* Blog administrators can successfully select a "Previous Post" and a "Next Post" for a blog post within the post editing interface.
* The system automatically updates the "Previous Post" field of the designated "Next Post" and vice-versa.
* The post editing interface only allows administrators to select "Previous" and "Next" posts that belong to the same series as the current post.
* The "Previous Episode" link is not displayed if no previous post is set.
* The "Next Episode" link is not displayed if no next post is set.

**8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Implementation)**

* Displaying a visual progress indicator for the series (e.g., "Episode 2 of 5").
* Allowing administrators to define a specific order for posts within a series through a drag-and-drop interface rather than individual post linking.
* Automatically suggesting potential previous and next posts based on publication date or other criteria.

**9. Open Questions**

* What should be the exact terminology used for the navigation links/buttons ("Episode," "Part," "Post," etc.)? This should be consistent with the user's blog content.
* Where should the "Previous Episode" and "Next Episode" links/buttons be positioned on the single post page?
* How should the selection of previous and next posts be implemented in the admin interface (dropdown, search with autocomplete)?

This PRD outlines the requirements for the series navigation feature. The development team should use this document as a guide for implementation and clarify any open questions before starting development.
