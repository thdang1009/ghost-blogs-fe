# Product Requirements Document: Subscribe to Tag Feature

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a "Subscribe to Tag" feature to be implemented on the blog platform. This feature will allow users (both logged-in and guests) to subscribe to specific tags associated with blog posts and receive notifications when new content matching those tags is published.

## 2. Goals

* To increase user engagement by providing a personalized way to stay updated on topics of interest.
* To drive more traffic to the blog by notifying interested users about new relevant content.
* To enhance user experience by offering a convenient way to follow specific content categories.
* To allow both registered and anonymous users to subscribe to content updates.

## 3. Target Users

* Existing blog readers who have specific interests within the blog's topics.
* New users who discover the blog through specific content and want to stay updated on similar posts.
* Users who prefer to receive notifications rather than regularly checking the blog for new content, regardless of whether they have an account.

## 4. Functional Requirements

* **Tagging System:**
    * Blog posts can have one or multiple tags assigned to them.
    * Tags should be clearly visible on individual blog post pages.
* **Subscription Interface:**
    * **On Post Page:** A clear and easily accessible "Subscribe to these tags" button or link should be present on each blog post page, allowing users to subscribe to **all** the tags associated with that post.
    * **User Profile/Settings (Logged-in Users):** A dedicated section within the logged-in user's profile or account settings should allow them to:
        * View a list of their currently subscribed tags.
        * Unsubscribe from tags.
* **Subscription Action:**
    * When a user clicks the "Subscribe to these tags" button:
        * **Logged-in User:** The system will retrieve the user's ID. All tags from the current blog post will be added to their subscription list. An API call will be made to `PUT v1/subscribe` with the following body:
          ```json
          {
            "userId": "[current_user_id]",
            "subscribe": ["tagId1", "tagId2", ...]
          }
          ```
        * **Guest User:**
            * A prompt will appear asking for their email address.
            * **Frontend Validation:** The provided email address must be validated using standard email format validation.
            * Upon valid email submission, all tags from the current blog post will be associated with this email for subscription. An API call will be made to `PUT v1/subscribe` (Note: The API might need to be adapted to handle guest users. See clarification below).
* **Notification System:**
    * **Trigger:** When a new blog post is published, the system should identify the tags associated with it.
    * **Matching Subscribers:**
        * For each tag on the new post, the system should identify all logged-in users who have subscribed to that tag.
        * For each tag on the new post, the system should identify all guest emails associated with that tag.
    * **Notification Delivery:** An email notification should be sent to each identified subscriber (both logged-in and guest).
    * **Notification Content:** The email notification should include:
        * The title of the new blog post.
        * A brief excerpt or summary of the post.
        * A direct link to the full blog post.
        * The names of the tags the user is subscribed to that triggered this notification.
        * The name of the blog.
        * An option for the user (both logged-in and guest) to unsubscribe from the specific tag(s) that triggered the email or manage all their subscriptions (for logged-in users, this links to their profile; for guest users, a unique unsubscribe link will be required).
* **Subscription Management (Guest Users):**
    * Guest users will receive a unique link in each notification email that allows them to unsubscribe from specific tags or all tags they are currently subscribed to.
* **User Authentication:**
    * Logged-in users are identified by their session or authentication token.
* **API Endpoint Clarification for Guest Users:**
    * The `PUT v1/subscribe` API endpoint and its current body structure are designed for logged-in users with a `userId`. For guest users, the backend API needs to be updated to handle subscriptions based on email addresses. This might involve:
        * Extending the existing API to accept an optional `email` field in the body.
        * Creating a separate API endpoint specifically for guest subscriptions (e.g., `PUT v1/guest-subscribe`).
        * The API body for guest users would likely include the `email` and the `subscribe` array of `tagId`s.
        * Example (potential extension of existing API):
          ```json
          {
            "userId": "[optional_user_id]",
            "email": "[optional_guest_email]",
            "subscribe": ["tagId1", "tagId2", ...]
          }
          ```
    * The backend logic needs to differentiate between logged-in user subscriptions (based on `userId`) and guest user subscriptions (based on `email`).
* **Admin Interface:**
    * Blog administrators should have access to data on tag subscriptions, including counts for both logged-in users and guest emails. (This can be a phase 2 requirement).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Usability:** The subscription process should be simple and intuitive for both logged-in and guest users. Managing subscriptions should also be straightforward.
* **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of tags and subscribers (both users and emails) without performance degradation.
* **Reliability:** The notification system should reliably deliver emails to all subscribers.
* **Performance:** The process of identifying subscribers and sending notifications should be efficient and not cause significant delays in post publishing.
* **Security:** User and email subscription data should be securely stored and protected. Users should only be able to manage their own subscriptions. Email addresses provided by guests should be treated with privacy.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase for the subscription feature should be well-structured and easy to maintain and update, considering both user types.

## 6. Technical Requirements

* **Platform:** [Specify the blog platform being used, e.g., WordPress, custom platform, etc.]
* **Programming Languages/Frameworks:** [Specify the relevant technologies]
* **Database:** [Specify the database used]
* **Email Service:** Integration with an email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) for sending notifications.
* **User Authentication System:** The existing user authentication system of the blog will be utilized for logged-in users. A separate mechanism for managing guest subscriptions based on email will be needed.

## 7. Release Criteria

* Users (both logged-in and guests) can successfully subscribe to all tags from a blog post page.
* Logged-in users can view and manage their tag subscriptions in their profile/settings.
* Guest users are prompted for a valid email address upon subscribing.
* When a new blog post is published, users and guest emails subscribed to the relevant tags receive email notifications.
* Email notifications contain the necessary information, links (including unsubscribe options), and the relevant tags.
* The subscription and notification system is stable and performs efficiently under expected load for both user types.
* Basic testing has been completed to ensure functionality and reliability for both logged-in and guest users.
* The backend API is correctly handling subscriptions for both logged-in users and guest emails (either through an extension or a new endpoint).

## 8. Success Metrics

* Number of logged-in users subscribing to tags.
* Number of guest email subscriptions.
* Number of tag subscriptions per user/email.
* Click-through rate from notification emails to the blog posts (separating logged-in and guest users if possible).
* Increase in blog traffic from users directed through tag subscription notifications.
* User feedback on the usefulness and ease of use of the feature for both user types.

## 9. Future Considerations (Optional)

* **Notification Preferences:** Allow users (including guests, potentially through a preference link in the email) to customize the frequency of notifications (e.g., instant, daily digest).
* **In-Blog Notifications:** Implement an in-blog notification system in addition to email notifications for logged-in users.
* **Tag Recommendations:** Suggest relevant tags to users based on their reading history or interests (for logged-in users).
* **Admin Analytics Dashboard:** Provide administrators with a detailed dashboard on tag subscription activity, separated by logged-in users and guest emails.
* **Double Opt-in for Guest Users:** Implement a double opt-in process for guest subscriptions to ensure email validity and user consent.

This updated PRD includes the specific requirements for handling both logged-in and guest users for the "Subscribe to Tag" feature. It also highlights the need for clarification and potential updates to the backend API to accommodate guest email subscriptions.
