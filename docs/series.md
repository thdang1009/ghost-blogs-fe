# Product Requirements Document: Blog Series Feature

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a new "Series" feature to be implemented on the blog platform. This feature will allow blog administrators to group related posts into series, assign predefined tags to these series, and provide a dedicated page for users to view all posts within a specific series. This will improve content organization and discoverability for users and enhance SEO for series topics.

**2. Goals**

* Improve the organization and discoverability of related blog posts.
* Allow administrators to easily manage groups of posts related to specific topics.
* Automate the process of tagging posts within a series with a consistent set of base tags.
* Enhance user experience by providing a dedicated page to browse content within a series.
* Improve SEO by associating a representative image with each series.

**3. User Stories**

* As a blog administrator, I want to be able to create new series with a name, representative image, and a set of base tags.
* As a blog administrator, I want to be able to edit existing series to update their name, image, or base tags.
* As a blog administrator, I want to be able to delete existing series.
* As a blog administrator, when creating or editing a blog post, I want to be able to select a series for that post.
* As a blog administrator, when I select a series for a post, I want the system to automatically add the base tags of that series to the post's tags, replacing any existing tags.
* As a blog administrator, I want to see a list of all series in the administrative interface.
* As a blog administrator, I want to see which series a post belongs to in the post list view.
* As a blog user, I want to be able to view a dedicated page listing all posts belonging to a specific series.
* As a blog user Browse the homepage, I want to see the series that a post belongs to and be able to click on it to view all posts in that series.
* As a blog user Browse a post on the /post-by page, I want to see the series that the post belongs to and be able to click on it to view all posts in that series.
* As a search engine bot (Google, Facebook, Twitter), when crawling the `/post-by-series?series={name}` page, I want to see a representative image for the series.

**4. Functional Requirements**

**4.1. Series Management Interface:**

* **List Series:** A new administrative interface will display a list of all existing series. This list should include the series name and potentially a thumbnail of the series image.
* **Create Series:** An option to create a new series will be available. The creation form will include the following fields:
    * **Series Name (Required):** A text field for the administrator to enter the name of the series.
    * **Series Image (Required):** An image upload field for the administrator to select a representative image for the series.
    * **Base Tags (Required):** A multi-select or tag input field for the administrator to define the core set of tags associated with this series.
* **Edit Series:** An option to edit an existing series will be available. The edit form will be pre-populated with the current series data (name, image, tags) and will allow modification of these fields.
* **Delete Series:** An option to delete an existing series will be available. A confirmation step should be included to prevent accidental deletion.
* **API Endpoints:** Corresponding backend API endpoints (likely RESTful) will be required to support these functionalities (e.g., `/api/series` for listing, creating, updating, and deleting series).
* **Data Model:** A data model will be created to represent a "Series" object, including fields for name (string), image URL (string), and base tags (array of strings).
* **Service Layer:** A service layer will handle the business logic for interacting with the series data model and the underlying API.

**4.2. Post by Series Page:**

* **New Route:** A new frontend route will be created at `/post-by-series?series={name}`.
* **Content Display:** This page will display a list of all published blog posts that are associated with the series specified in the `series` query parameter.
* **Series Image Display:** The representative image selected during series creation will be displayed prominently on this page, likely at the top.
* **SEO Metadata:** The page should include appropriate meta tags for SEO, including the series name in the title and description. The series image should be included in the Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata for sharing purposes.

**4.3. Post Editing Page Modifications:**

* **Series Selection Field:** A new dropdown or select field will be added to the post editing form, located *before* the existing tag selection field. This field will allow the administrator to choose a series from the list of available series.
* **Automatic Tagging Logic:** When an administrator selects a series:
    * The system will first remove all existing tags from the current post.
    * The system will then automatically add all the base tags associated with the selected series to the post's tags.
* **Data Persistence:** The post data model will be updated to include a field to store the ID or name of the series the post belongs to.

**4.4. Post List Page Modifications:**

* **New Column:** A new column labeled "Series" will be added to the administrative post list view.
* **Series Name Display:** This column will display the name of the series that each post is currently associated with. If a post does not belong to any series, this column should be empty.

**4.5. Homepage Post Display Modifications:**

* **Series Indicator:** For each blog post displayed on the homepage, a small section (ideally located at the bottom left of the post preview) will display the name of the series the post belongs to.
* **Navigation Link:** The series name displayed will be a clickable link that navigates the user to the corresponding `/post-by-series?series={name}` page.

**4.6. Post By Tag Page Modifications:**

* **Series Indicator:** For each blog post displayed on the `/post-by` page (listing posts by a specific tag), a small section (ideally located at the bottom left of the post preview) will display the name of the series the post belongs to.
* **Navigation Link:** The series name displayed will be a clickable link that navigates the user to the corresponding `/post-by-series?series={name}` page.

**5. Technical Requirements**

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation should align with the existing technology stack of the blog platform (e.g., programming language, framework, database).
* **API Development:** Backend API endpoints need to be developed for managing series data.
* **Database Schema:** The database schema will need to be updated to include a table or collection for storing series information and a field in the post table/collection to link posts to series.
* **Frontend Development:** Frontend components and views will need to be created or modified to implement the user interface and display changes.
* **Image Handling:** The system should handle image uploads and storage for series images.
* **SEO Considerations:** Ensure proper SEO implementation for the new `/post-by-series` pages, including meta tags and image handling for search engine bots.

**6. UI/UX Considerations**

* The series management interface should be intuitive and easy to use for blog administrators.
* The series selection on the post edit page should be clear and placed logically within the form.
* The display of series information on the homepage and `/post-by` pages should be visually consistent and not disrupt the existing layout.
* The `/post-by-series` page should have a clean and readable layout, clearly displaying the series image and the list of associated posts.

**7. Acceptance Criteria**

* Blog administrators can successfully create, edit, and delete series through the administrative interface.
* Blog administrators can select a series for a blog post on the post edit page.
* Selecting a series automatically updates the post's tags with the base tags of the selected series, removing any prior tags.
* The administrative post list page displays the correct series name for each post.
* The `/post-by-series?series={name}` page correctly displays all posts belonging to the specified series and shows the representative series image.
* Clicking on the series name on the homepage and `/post-by` pages navigates to the correct `/post-by-series` page.
* The series image is correctly included in the SEO metadata of the `/post-by-series` pages.
* The API endpoints for series management are functional and secure.
* The database schema is updated to support the series feature.

**8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Implementation)**

* Allowing administrators to define the order of posts within a series.
* Providing more advanced filtering or sorting options on the `/post-by-series` page.
* Displaying a list of all series on a dedicated "Series" index page.

**9. Open Questions**

* How should the series image be handled in terms of resizing and optimization for different display sizes?
* What is the maximum number of base tags allowed per series?
* Should there be any limitations on the number of series a post can belong to (initially, it's assumed a post belongs to only one series)?

This PRD provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for the blog series feature. This document will serve as a guide for the development team during the implementation process.
